/*
 * Notes:
 * 1. The string that the split method takes can also be a regular expression.
 * 2. The split method is overloaded, with some versions of the method coming from the 
 * Java String class and some coming from the Scala StringLike class. For instance, if 
 * we call split with a Char argument instead of a String argument, weâ€™re using the 
 * split method from StringLike.
