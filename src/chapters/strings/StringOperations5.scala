/* 
 * Notes:
 * 1. To write a for loop to work like a map method, add a yield statement to the end of the loop.
 * 2. Adding yield to a for loop essentially places the result from each loop iteration into a 
 * temporary holding area. When the loop completes, all of the elements in the holding area are 
 * returned as a single collection.
 * 3. Whereas the map or for/yield approaches are used to transform one collection into another, 
 * the foreach method is typically used to operate on each element without returning a result. 
 * This is useful for situations like printing.
 * 4. map treats a String as a sequential collection of Char elements. The map method has an 
 * implicit loop, and in that loop, it passes one Char at a time to the algorithm itâ€™s given.
